# loan-accept-or-reject

This was my first complete project which taught me a lot during the journey. As this was my first project, I completely understand the hardship a beginner faces while making such an effort.So i will try to make my approach as simple as possible so that any beginner can understand it with ease.

The project is basically done to make a web-app which will tell the candidates whether their loan application is likely to be accepted or rejected on the basis of the information they give.
The entire model was build on Google Colab  and flask was used for web-app.
